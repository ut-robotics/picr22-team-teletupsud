# Teletupsud mainboard and motor drivers


The brain of the mainboard is STM32G441KBT6 MCU. You can program it with port on the board using STlink. It's powered with 3.3V. That voltage is achieved from USB-s 5V, which goes through NCP164CSN330T1G to drop voltage from 5V to 3.3V
USB is also protected with CM1223-02SO TVS diode package. The motor driver side and mainboard side are isolated from each other. To get MCU signals from one side to another, it uses MAX14930DASE+ isolators.
Motor drivers, that are used, are DRV8243HQRXYRQ1. Because in our setup, DRVOFF is connected to ground, the drivers are always on, but they are sleeping. To wake them up, MCU sends nsleep signals in a small period of time to them. Driver gets two signals, one is PWM and another is direction. The direction signal assigns the direction for the motor. 0 is one way, 1 is another way
